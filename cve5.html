  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>From autumn 2014 to spring 2016, I took part in the organisation of a TEDx event at the UTC (2 editions). During the first edition, I was the logistic manager. I became president and licence owner for the second editions. Both went well, and since then another one took place.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>The organisation of this event came with a lot of challenges. The first one was make three visions cohabitate :</p>
<ul>
<li>our vision as event organizers and tech enthousiasts</li>
<li>TED global guidelines, which are really restrictive</li>
<li>Our school vision, as they were financing the event and providing their name and location.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we needed to find insightfull speakers willing to come talk for free, in a conference where they are limited to a 18 minute talk and where they share the stage. This is way harder than it seems, but with the power of the TED name and perseverance, we were really happy with the lineup we got. It is also to note that some really big names (Cedric Villanie, Fields Medal and Serge Haroche, Nobel prize) agreed to come but couldn't due to agenda issues.</p>
<p>The location provided it's own challenges, from security concerns to set design.</p>
