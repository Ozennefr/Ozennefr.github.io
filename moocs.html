    <h1>1. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-driven-astronomy/home/info">Data-driven Astronomy (University of Sydney)</a></h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This course is centered around the use of traditionnal machine learning techniques in Astronomy.</p>
<p>Modern telescopes produce terabytes of data per observation, and the simulations required to model our observable Universe push supercomputers to their limits. To analyze the data, machine learning is a very good alternative to classical methods.</p>
<p>The programming assignments were centered around use cases and done in python 3.</p>
<h2>Course outline:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Week 1: Thinking about data - Principles of computational thinking - Discovering pulsars in radio images </li>
<li>Week 2: Big data makes things slow - How to work out the time complexity of algorithms - Exploring the black holes at the centres of massive galaxies </li>
<li>Week 3: Querying data using SQL - How to use databases to analyse your data - Investigating exoplanets in other solar systems </li>
<li>Week 4: Managing your data - How to set up databases to manage your data - Exploring the lifecycle of stars in our Galaxy </li>
<li>Week 5: Learning from data: regression - Using machine learning tools to investigate your data - Calculating the redshifts of distant galaxies </li>
<li>Week 6: Learning from data: classification - Using machine learning tools to classify your data - Investigating different types of galaxies</li>
</ul>
<h2>Review</h2>
<p>This cours was pretty easy to follow, but was a really great introduction to a handfull of common machine learning technics. </p>
<p>All the data we used was from real world telescopes, which is really the strong point of this course. It applies ML to real world data and to perform non trivial tasks (classifying galaxies, calculating redshifts, weighing black holes...). Moreover, the course emphasis the need to gather knowledge from models instead of just looking at the prediction and treating the algorithms as black boxes.</p>
<h1>2. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-mechanics/home/info">Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations (École normale supérieure)</a></h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The course is centered on the statistical approach to quantum mechanics. Along the way, a lot is learned about markov chains and sampling. Simulated annealing is also studied.</p>
<h2>Course outline</h2>
<ul>
<li>Week 1: Monte Carlo algorithms (Direct sampling, Markov-chain sampling)</li>
<li>Week 2: Hard disks: From Classical Mechanics to Statistical Mechanics</li>
<li>Week 3: Entropic interactions and phase transitions</li>
<li>Week 4: Sampling and integration</li>
<li>Week 5: Density matrices and Path integrals (Quantum Statistical mechanics 1/3)</li>
<li>Week 6: Lévy Quantum Paths (Quantum Statistical mechanics 2/3)</li>
<li>Week 7: Bose-Einstein condensation (Quantum Statistical mechanics 3/3)</li>
<li>Week 8: Ising model - Enumerations and Monte Carlo algorithms</li>
<li>Week 9: Dynamic Monte Carlo, simulated annealing</li>
<li>Week 10: The Alpha and the Omega of Monte Carlo, Review, Party</li>
</ul>
<h2>Review</h2>
<p>This course is really dense. The quantum mechanic part is by far the hardest, but still manageable with only a classicla mechanic background. I really enjoyed the courses about Markov chains and all of its uses. Sampling is an interesting problem that comes a lot in sequence models, and markov chains are a really elegnt way to implement it.</p>
<h1>3. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info">Machine Learning (Université de Stanford)</a></h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Its main aim is to introduce and explore neural networks, so it glances over some widely used techniques such as decision trees, hashing, etc...</p>
<h2>Course outline</h2>
<ul>
<li>Week 1: Linear Regression with One Variable</li>
<li>Week 2: Linear Regression with Multiple Variables</li>
<li>Week 3: Logistic Regression and regularization</li>
<li>Week 4: Neural Networks: Representation</li>
<li>Week 5: Neural Networks: Learning</li>
<li>Week 6: Advice for Applying Machine Learning and Machine Learning System Design</li>
<li>Week 7: Support Vector Machines</li>
<li>Week 8: Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction</li>
<li>Week 9: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems</li>
<li>Week 10: Large Scale Machine Learning</li>
<li>Week 11: Application Example: Photo OCR</li>
</ul>
<h2>Review</h2>
<p>This cours main aim is to introduce and explore neural networks, so it glances over some widely used techniques such as decision trees, hashing, etc..</p>
<p>When it comes to NN though, the course content is really interesting and usefull. It's a must do for all people wanting to learn ML online !</p>
