    <h1>About</h1>
    

    <p>Currently pursuing degree in mechanical engineering, I am studying ways to apply machine learning to my main interests : the aero-spacial and automotive industries. I use these new technologies to predict, classify behaviours and derive knowledge of complex systems.</p>
<p>I believe that my double interest in both AI and mechanical engineering will help 
avoid black box systems, while still being able to stay up-to-date on 
the technology. 
As a mechanical engineering graduate, I will be able to chose the right tools, communicate efficiently with experts of your field and incorporate their knowledge in the model.</p>
